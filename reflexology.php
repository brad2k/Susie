<h2>Reflexology</h2>

<p>The art of balancing the energy meridians in the body.</p>

<p>Our bodies are controlled by an electrical system that influences every organ, gland and nerve. When that system slows down, shuts down or is traumatized, the flow of energy becomes inhibited, causing soreness, pain and illness. Reflexology uses pin-point pressure techniques on various points of the feet, hands and ears that naturally restore the flow of energy. This simple "miracle of magic" healing has been overlooked for many years because of its simplicity. Now good health and freedom of pain can be just fingertips away.</p>
