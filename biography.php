<h2>About Susie</h2>

<p>Susie Byleckie is an experienced esthetician that has been established in the Sacramento cosmetology community for twenty-five years. As an esthetician, Susie frequently attends classes on skin care and treatment. Of these classes, a five-day medical course on the cause and effect of various skin conditions has been integral in Susie's development as a skincare specialist.</p>

<p>Susie's clients benefit from her ability to correct and prevent severe dry skin, acne, and oily skin problems.  She approaches each client's specific needs with a tailored skincare program that includes treatments and proper product use.</p>

<p>One of Susie's most positive traits is her bedside manner.  Once Susie has touched a client via consultation or an actual skin experience, she has created a rapport with that person. It is in this way that Susie has created a strong referral business.</p>

<p>Susie is proficient in the practices of microdermabrasion, peeling and reflexology. She uses a "sugaring" technique for hair removal that is very effective and is much less invasive than a standard waxing.  Also, she offers her clients consultation and application of Jane Iredale Mineral Cosmetics with the intention of creating a healthy, natural look.
In her recent past she has gravitated to mature skin problems.</p>

<p>With a strong focus on professionalism and a personal approach to skin care, Susie is an outstanding resource for all of your skincare needs and concerns.</p>

<p>She has resided at <a href="http://www.cezanneskinspasacramento.com/" rel="nofollow">C&#0233;zanne Skin Spa</a> for 10 years.  Please ask for Susie when you call and tell the receptionist how you got her name.</p>
